## The Daily Noodle, stirring up the news

Project for mediacollege Techjam 07/09/2023, made in 4 hours

# Project using React, TailwindCSS, PHP, mySQL

Made in React for component usage and further learning and since I simply enjoy using react more.
Using tailwind for ease of access.
Php for API integration, rather use fetch than php pages for ease of access.

## Project setup on own device

Clone this project then run

`cd dailynoodle_website`

`npm i`

`npm start`

And that's it! Enjoy!

## Sidenote

I've censored the database connection details in dailynoodle_API/index.php in case you were trying to get into it :p (the workings are still the exact same, I simply used .gitignore to censor it further)
